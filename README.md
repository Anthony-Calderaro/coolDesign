When using a preprocessor like SASS, it must be compiled at runtime (webpack/gulp) or manually (command line commands).
Once SASS is installed, create 2 files: an `input.scss` file. The SCSS file will be where all of your changes are made. 
If you are manually compiling, you will need to declare the stylesheet reference on your `index.html` file as `<link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' href='output.css' />`

# Manual Compilation:
When compiling manually, use the command `sass input.scss output.css`. This will create a compiled output.css file which will sync with your html file. Magic!
